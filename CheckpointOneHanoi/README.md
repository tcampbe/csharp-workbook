## C# Workbook

### Towers of Hanoi Project
My towers of hanoi program will Store numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in a stack 
	with key A. 

It will then create two additional stacks with keys b and c.

It will represent these stacks on the console by printing the key 
	and the numbers, with the numbers in reverse order for visual conituity.

It will then ask the user to choose a stack to move from and another 
	to move to, and ask again if incorrect input is used.

It will track and display changes to each stack as they are made.

It will not allow moves that violate the rules. 
	ie. each number can only move to an empty stack or onto a higher number.

It will finally announce if the user has won, (by moving all numbers to
	a stack other than a), and it will note the newly filled stack.
    ```

### The Purpose
When complete any user should be able to run the program and play 
	a console version of the game "Towers Of Hanoi". Hopefully, this 
	will be an enjoyable experience and achieve a High Grade. 

### How to Play
steps 1-4

1 run the program
2 follow the instructions on the console screen
3 know the rules, only the top number can be moved and only to 
	a position on a higher number or empty stack, 3 can not go atop 2.
4 use planning and strategy to move all numbers from stack a to another stack.

### Deficiencies noted by the programmer
Although, like my children, I believe all of my creations are beautifull, 
	there are a few descrepancies.

I was unable to determine a method to break up the program, so it is one 
	big, ugly block of code. Also, like my children, in my own image.

I have determined that the use of a dictionary would improve the flow and 
	offer oppurtunities to break it up. If there is time I will address this 
	issue, but it will take a ground up rebuild, so this is not likely 
	before the due date.




Any feedback is both accepted and appreciated.
